# RHDevs Workflows AY20/21
This document shares about how RHDevs conducts its workflows in the different stages of the AY. To find out more about each specific period, click on the hyper links below: 

1. [Semester 1 Workflow](#1.-sem1-workflow)
1. [Winter Workflow](#2.-winter-workflow)
1. [Semester 2 Workflow](#3.-Sem-2-Workflow)

To supplement the understanding of our workflow, click below to view the tools that RHDevs have decided to experiment with in the  current AY.

### 1. Sem 1 Workflow 
`Manpower Unit: Departmental`

By chronological  flow, RHDevs needed much setting up and sync-ups in order for all members to align to the young organisation's goals and visions. In this period, the workflow revolved around each department with little to no cross-departmental collaborations. In this period, COVID was at its peak and the hall management rejected our in-person meetings. Working around this constraint, we used `google meet` as our primary communication medium.

```JavaScript
Concept and Goals: 
	1. Orientate and set-up work environments. 
	2. Get members up to speed on their own domains
```
- Graphics Design

The Graphics designers managed to lay foundations, in terms of our identity and design guidelines. These can be seen in our deliverables and quantifiables in Sem 1:  - Branding Guide  - Logo  - RHDevs Merchandise  - Social Media Accounts

- UIUX

For the new budding UIUX designers of the team, there was much learning to go around. In the first half of the semester (Week 4 - Week 9), we have seen more UX 
```JavaScript
Concept and Goals: 
	1. Formalise knowledge and take certifications for each domain	
	2. Finalise CCA directions and Alignment of Learning goals of members
	3. Administrative matters with Hall management (Finance, CCA points, etc)
```
- Developers
  - Frontend
  - Backend
  - Telegram Bot

### 2. Winter Workflow
`Manpower Unit: Departmental`

```JavaScript
Concept: 
	1. Launch our Version1.0.0 by start of Semester 2
	2. Create a Wireframe base for UIUX and Working Code / Environment for future developments
	3. Create awareness on RHDevs branding in hall, create association of RHDevs to our projects 
```

- Backend
- Telegram Bot
- UIUX
- Graphics Design



### 3. Sem 2 Workflow
`Manpower Unit: Parties`

The workflow in Semester 2 will differ greatly from Semester 1 and Winter. We will engage in concurrent development across different features and tasks. This strategy is in response to the pain-points and challenges from a `departmental` workflow (which could not be avoided, having untrained members and a lack of materials). With this workflow, there should be closer unity among the different domains in the team itself.

- What is a `party`?	
  - In Semester 2, our workflow will revolve around `parties`. In other organisations, this may be refered to as `tribes`, `taskforce`, `workgroups`, `mini-teams`. In each `party`, there will be members from every domain, and is headed by one product manager. The task of each `party` is clearly stated before its formation. The diffusion of the `party` will only happen when the task and milestone on hand has been completed, subject to the Product Manger's set KPI and OKRs. 
  - Tasks assignment to Parties may vary. It can be a bug-hunt-and-fix, a new feature, a new product entirelty, or a side project. 
  - Each RHDevs member can, and is encouraged to be in 1 or more, but less than 3 parties. 
  - The Product Manager will function as a pseudo-scrum-master, if he or she decides to adopt agile methodologies in the team.

- Why a `Party`?
  - In Semester 2, we will be focusing on building unto the foundations that we have set during Winter (Dec 2020). As such, this calls for diversification and disintegration of departments into mini parties, which allows for concurrent development of features.
    - Due to small team size, and a different team integrity (less number of decision-making stakeholders of different domains in one party), decisions can be made in quicker iterations and the feedback loops will be kept active.  

- What is the role of a department head then?
  - When in a `Party`, the head will function as the role of  whichever domain he or she is from. (e.g. Dora, Lead designer, will function as a designer in this party)
  - The lead can, but is discouraged, to not join any parties. 
  - Beyond his or her role in any `party`, the lead will engage in higher-level strategy decision making, such as those of discussing new features. The lead should be one providing domain knowledge and advice in each discussion. 
  - Above all, the lead's purpose does not change; in ensuring quality work and goals cum learning-outcome alignment from all in the respective departments.
```
Feel free to disagree: 
The role of a leader cum manager is never to do the work; [The Point]
But to find the right person for the right job, [Your Task]
So as to ensure mission success. [Your Concept]
```
